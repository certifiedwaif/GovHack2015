I think I took three or four frames, and I knew when I clicked the camera it was a really important image. Years later, I read they were going to open a National Portrait gallery in Canberra. I didn't know where the picture was, but I called the director and said 'I've got a shot you need for your gallery'. It took me six months to find it. They bought it before the gallery opened, and used it on the invite for the opening.
