# True Stories

True Stories is a project made for [GovHack](http://govhack.org) Australia 2015 by team [Potato Heads](#team-potato-heads).

The primary goal of True Stories is to promote viewership of the 8500 photo stories in the [ABC Local Stories archive](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/3fd356c6-0ad4-453e-82e9-03af582024c3). We create a [Google Chrome Extension] which shows you a different story every time you open a new tab. We believe that this is a fun, friendly and non-intrusive way to add a bit of ABC local to your life.

It doesn't get in your way, and if you see something interesting, there are links to dive deeper into the archive and find out more about the story that you're looking at!

We've enriched the data with [ABS data](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/2071.0main+features1132016) on the local area and shown it on a map on our website as well, allowing you explore Australia.

See more info on our [website](https://truestories.david-ma.net/). Or just go ahead and download the [Google Chrome Extension]!

# To do
